# scrolling_text
This is a small package I am using to create scrolling text for my microbit.

## Nightly?
I think nightly is currently required because I am using derive in a embedded repo and I think that is a nightly only feature.

If I remove the use of derive, I think I can run on stable Rust.

## Running Tests
```
cargo +nightly test
```
